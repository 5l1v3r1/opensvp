Introduction
============

Opensvp is a security tool. Its aim is to provide a tools to test the
resistance of firewall to protocol level attack.

For example, opensvp is able under some condition (see explanation
below for details) to open a pin hole in a firewall protecting a
ftp server: even if the filtering policy garantee that only the 21
port is open to the server, you can open 'any' port on the server
by using opensvp.

Lets have 192.168.2.3 a server running ftp, placed behind a firewall.
If the user, as root, runs::

 ./opensvp.py --server 192.168.2.3 --helper ftp --port 23 -v -i eth0

Then he will have a temporary access on port 23 of the server independantly
of the firewall rules.


Attack Description
==================
Principle
---------

Some network protocols are using multiple connections  for the exchange
between a client and a server. The most known example is ftp where command
goes through a connection on port 21 and where data exchange are done with
two different mode (connection from port 20 or dynamic connection).

Some firewall implementation implement application layer gateway (ALG) to be
able to detect this parallel connection and be able to autorize them dynamically.
Other solutions are to use application relay (transparent proxy) or to open
all the possible flow (read almost everything).

The ALG analyse the traffic and detect and parse the command sent between the
peers to declare the parameters of the parallel connections. Once done they
open temporary pin hole in the firewall to let the probable traffic goes through.

The idea of this attack is to forge this type of messages to open pin hole in
the firewall but pin hole that should not have been open.

This attack is now to work on Netfilter firewall if rp_filter is set to
0 (this is hopefully not the default value). This could work on other
firewall but has not yet been tested.

Condition:
 * Attacker computer is on a network directly connected to the firewall.
 * Firewall is sensible to the attack (for example, Netfilter with rp_filter
   set to 0)
 * Attacker is able to sniff data packet (or by pcap sniffing or by running
   himself a data connection)

The cinematic is the following :
 1. Sniffer on the attacker network capture one packet from the protocol flow

     * it reverse the ethernet dst and src
     * it increase id in IP and seq for TCP
     * it set payload to the wanted command (with selected
       port)

 2. The forged packet is sent on the interface connected to the firewall
 3. Firewall transmit the packet back to the client and is now expecting
    a packet with caracteristic based on attacker input

Attacking IRC
-------------

This attack is a direct application of the described principle. Once data packet
is received, the attacker send a forged DCC command.

Attacking FTP
-------------

In this attack, the client connection is open by the attacker. He connect to the
ftp server behind a firewall and initiate a real connection. Once the session is
setup, he launch the attack by sending a forged 227 command.
